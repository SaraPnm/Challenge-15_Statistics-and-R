# Challenge-15_Statistics-and-R

## Project Overview
We'll apply our understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. The datasets include:  
 - The results of an mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.
 - MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.


The goals of this challenge are to:
1. Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
2. Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
3. Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
4. Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
